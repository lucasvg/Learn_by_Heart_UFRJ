Introduction
The main idea behind this project rests on the learning process of any language, be it English, Portuguese, Spanish, or any other. For those who are learning on their own, however, there is a certain moment during this process in which the presence of a teacher becomes highly essential, such as when delving into the fundamentals of grammar and spelling. Consequently, in this crucial stage, the learner depends solely on their own efforts. These circumstances allow for a higher probability of failing to recall important words needed to express thoughts and ideas in the language being acquired. The key to solving this problem lies in the expansion and development of vocabulary. Our focus aims at helping to increase the client’s vocabulary by playing games.

Project Presentation
The system will consist of two modules - an Android application and a server - both in communication with each other. This will allow the client to make use of different devices. The client will be able to add words to the system, which may include multiple meanings, each with its own examples. Moreover, the words may be segregated into different groups, or “dictionaries”, for easier access. Currently, there is only one type of user, but new features can be added in the future, such as a web interface.
